# Multi-tool Healthcare Data Science

This project is ongoing and will perform data cleaning, visualisation, and modeling using SQL and Python on a healthcare dataset.

## Files

- `Stage 1 - SQL Analysis.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for cleaning and analysis.
- `Cleaned_healthcare_dataset.csv`: The final exported dataset after processing in SQL.
- `healthcare_dataset.csv`: Raw data.
- 'Stage 2 - ML using Python (Jupyter Notebook).ipynb': Contains all the Python analysis and modeling.

## Steps:

- Data cleaning: trimming names, detecting nulls, etc.
- Querying using window functions.
- Doing some useful EDA.
- Exporting cleaned results as CSV.
- Then moved on to Python and did some more EDA on the Jupyter notebook.
- Modeling (predicting the 'Test Results' variable).

## How to Use:

1. Import `healthcare_dataset.csv` into MySQL.
2. Follow the instructions in the beginning comments in the `Stage 1 - SQL Analysis.sql` file regarding the Excel file pre processing before stating the SQL work.
3. Run the queries in `Stage 1 - SQL Analysis.sql`.
4. Export the final result if needed.
5. Run the Python Jupyter notebook EDA and modeling cells.

## Tools Used:

- MySQL.
- Git.
- MySQL Workbench.
- Jupyter Notebook.
